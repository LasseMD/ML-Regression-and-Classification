# ML - Supervised Regression Learning and Classification

This repository contains code for implementing supervised regression learning and classification techniques using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## Techniques Implemented:

### 1. Supervised Regression Learning:
- **Linear Regression:**
  - Importing and loading data using Pandas.
  - Data visualization using Seaborn.
  - Fitting a simple linear OLS regression line to the data.
  - Evaluating model performance using the coefficient of determination ($R^2$-value).
  - Fitting ordinary least squares, Ridge, and LASSO regression models.
  - Comparing the performance of different regression models.

### 2. Classification:
- **Logistic Regression:**
  - Loading data from an Excel file using Pandas.
  - Exploratory data analysis using Seaborn.
  - Building a logistic regression model to predict bean class.
  - Evaluating model accuracy using the score() method.

- **Gaussian Naive Bayes:**
  - Building a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier.
  - Evaluating model accuracy using the score() method.
  - Visualizing the classifier's performance using a scatterplot.

## Libraries Used:
- Pandas: For data manipulation and loading.
- Seaborn: For data visualization, including pair plots and scatter plots.
- Matplotlib: For additional data visualization and plotting regression lines.
- Scikit-learn: For implementing regression and classification models, including linear regression, logistic regression, and Gaussian Naive Bayes.
